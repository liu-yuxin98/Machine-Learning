# Machine-Learning
This repository stores some class practises and projects for the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng courses which is the most popular machine learning courses in the world.
The courses project in the class is by MATLAB. However, Python for machine learing has become a trend so that I did the projects and assignments in Python.
